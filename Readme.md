## Experience

**Software Engineer Frontend** - [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) - February 2022 - Present

> Currently working in the experiments team working in new features for onboarding and guiding customers through the platform and improve the usage of forms. The features are developed in React and bundled with internal configuration of webpack. Jest, react-testing-library and cypress are used to validate and test the solutions. A backend with NodeJS/Typescript is also maintained by me and the team.

**Software Engineer - Javascript** - [Klarna](https://www.klarna.com/) - March 2020 - February 2022

> Worked in the Hosted Payment Page, which consists in a external payment integration for in-store and e-commerce merchants, being built in React bundled with webpack. As is a payment integration it is done with unit tests using jest and react testing library, along with webdriverIO and Browserstack to have e2e testing coverage. I also work in the Klarna app building a new way to pay in-store with QR codes. It is built with React Native, Redux and Most.JS to handle the user flows and Jest and Cypress to account for testing the app. I also work in a BFF layer which is a node lambda function that interfaces the app with multiple backends.

The checkout currently completes about 150k orders a day, also having the record of 650k orders last Black Friday. The Checkout UI SPA is composed by current (React, Redux) as well as legacy code (Knockout JS) living together. It's deployed using AWS CodeBuild, running unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library. For end2end tests we use Cypress running in CD for all cases and primary use cases for monitoring.

**Web Engineer** - [Huge](http://hugeinc.com) - November 2015 - May 2017
